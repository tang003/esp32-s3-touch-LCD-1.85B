# MOTO GPS Waveshare edition features and user manual

This manual corresponds to the repository's current Waveshare 1.75C and 1.85B firmware and iOS App. For a first
build, read the [buying and installation guide](WAVESHARE_DIY_GUIDE.en.md) first; for service
configuration see the [route gateway guide](GATEWAY_SETUP.en.md).

Updated 2026-10-01. This is a development build; TestFlight and App Store downloads are not yet open.
The redesigned native iOS interface groups search, recent places, "My round display", "Maps and offline
downloads", "Demo navigation" and "Privacy and data" on the "Set off" home page. The B1 custom board
is on hold while work focuses on the Waveshare edition. English UI labels in this manual describe the
current Chinese interface; they do not imply that the App has an English localisation.

## Gateway settings

Since 0.3.1, use the gear icon at the top left of the departure screen to open 网关设置. Enter your HTTPS base URL, use 测试连接 to check service status, then save. Changes apply immediately and persist across launches. Switching clears searches and pauses downloads while retaining downloaded maps; it is blocked during navigation. Without a Mac, follow the [IPA installation guide](IOS_SIDELOAD.en.md).

## 1. What the phone and the round display each do

The iPhone handles position, search, route preview and navigation computation; the round display
shows navigation, speed and heading over Bluetooth and sends touch actions back. Normal use requires
the phone to be nearby. Real search, route planning and rerouting use the phone's network connection,
and a personal hotspot is not required. The standalone GNSS and hotspot connectivity of the in-house
main board design are not part of this manual's Waveshare edition.

Choose the route on the phone before setting off; the round display is for checking the next action
and the distance. The current route source is the ordinary driving service, and it does not promise
automatic avoidance of motorcycle-prohibited roads; do your debugging and interaction while stopped.
Background reconnection and some route issues are still being verified; see
[Known issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.en.md) for details.

## 2. Power on, connection and power off

Power the device on; the round display plays the black-background white MOTO GPS boot screen. Open
MOTO GPS on the iPhone and the App scans for the device automatically; on the first connection, pair
and grant Bluetooth permission following the iOS prompts.

| Round-display state | Meaning | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Waiting for phone / CONNECT PHONE / WAITING FOR PHONE | No usable phone session has been established; the wording varies slightly with the firmware version | Open the App, check the Bluetooth permission, move closer to the device |
| CONNECTING / Establishing the connection | Discovering services and completing the handshake | Wait; if it does not change for a long time, look at the error in the App and retry |
| CONNECTED / Connection succeeded | A brief connection-success indication | Then it moves on to ready to ride or navigation |
| READY TO RIDE / Choose a destination on the phone | Connected, with no route currently displayed | Choose a destination on the phone |
| BUILDING ROUTE / Building the route | A route is being obtained | Wait for the phone to respond; if it fails, read the prompt on the phone |
| Navigation screen | A valid navigation state has been received | Check the selected route and the next action |

These states do not necessarily all stay on screen during every operation; the route preview can also
complete while the round display stays at ready to ride. The phone's physical Bluetooth connection and
the complete protocol handshake are two stages, so the standard is that both the App and the round
display are ready.

To stop using it, first end navigation in the App. On the 1.75C, hold PWR for about 3 seconds to
request a software power-off; its PMIC also has an approximately 4-second hardware fallback. The
USB, battery and combined-supply behaviour still awaits full acceptance. On the 1.85B, PWR belongs
to the board's power circuit; follow Waveshare's power instructions. On the 1.85B, a short BOOT press
changes pages while the screen is lit, and holding it for about 1.5 seconds turns off the backlight.
Holding BOOT during power-on still enters download mode.

## 3. Search and recent places

On the "Set off" home page, type at least two characters in "Search places or addresses", for example
a mall, a station or an address. The App waits briefly for the input to settle before searching, so
you do not have to tap again after every character.

When a phone position is available, results prefer nearby places; when there are no nearby results it
falls back to a regional / nationwide search. When location authorisation is missing or location is
temporarily unavailable, the interface explains the search scope, and you must not read every result
as nearby. For places with the same name, confirm using the city, the address and the distance, then
tap the search result to open the route page.

"Recent searches" keeps at most 8 places, and selecting one plans a route to it again; "Clear" removes
the recent entries. What is saved is the place, not a permanently cached live distance or an old
route. If you pick the wrong destination, use "Change" to go back and select again.

## 4. Review candidate routes and start navigation

After you select a destination, the "Route" page shows "Planning route".
The whole-route map and candidate list show at most 3 routes, each with the
estimated time, the distance and a traffic summary. One or two routes returned is also a normal
result; it does not invent routes to fill the list.

1. First confirm the two ends of the map and the selected destination.
2. Tap different candidates to compare the time, distance and route shown on the map.
3. Confirm the selected route, then tap "Start navigation". Selecting a place or browsing candidates
   alone does not send the route to the device as an active navigation in advance.
4. Once started, check the phone's navigation state and the round display's white route, action and
   distance.
5. If "Unable to plan route" appears, read the reason, check location, the gateway and network, then retry.

The first navigation currently uses the candidate you selected; later off-route and traffic updates
may request a new route. Some cross-city route and preview consistency issues have been recorded; if a
route obviously detours, stop relying on that result and record the reproduction conditions.

## 5. How to read the round-display navigation page

| Element on screen | What it expresses |
| --- | --- |
| Vehicle arrow in the middle | Reference for the current heading of the bike; the map moves and rotates around it |
| White line | The currently selected navigation route |
| Grey roads and buildings | Reference for the surroundings, sent by the phone as a local base-map window |
| Left-turn, right-turn, U-turn and similar icons | The next navigation action |
| Large numbers and m / km | The distance to the next action; not the Bluetooth distance between the round display and the phone |
| Circular route progress | A trip-progress indication when there is a valid route |
| Speed-limit sign | A trustworthy road-speed-limit source is not connected yet, so no real limit is shown; its absence does not mean the road is unrestricted |

With no valid route, the action, the distance, the progress and the speed limit are hidden, to avoid
showing old guidance. Route progress, off-route confirmation, rerouting and the arrival state are
updated by the phone; a brief GPS drift does not necessarily trigger a reroute immediately. Traffic
conditions refresh on the shared core's cycle, and a route may be fetched again after the network
recovers; this is not a traffic stream that updates live every second.

Traffic is currently used in route summaries and the circular progress arc. Complete red/yellow/green
colouring of individual route segments is still being developed, and traffic-light countdown is not connected.

Grey roads and buildings now load online by default and are no longer limited to Jinan. When the
network fails, the App uses downloaded regions, recent cache and the bundled Jinan base map; uncovered
areas may be missing. Completeness depends on local OSM data, and the display selects features within
its capacity. See section 10 for downloads.

## 6. Speedometer, heading and touch

Swipe left and right on the round display to switch pages. On the 1.85B, swiping left cycles navigation →
speedometer → heading → music → settings, and swiping right goes the other way; when the music capability is not
enabled the music page is skipped. The 1.75C does not show the settings page. The page indicator dots appear after a touch / page change and
retract after about 5 seconds of no operation. Use a fairly definite horizontal swipe; operating in
the middle of the round display is easier to recognise.
On the 1.85B, a short BOOT press and release also advances one page in the same order, skipping music
when unavailable. Holding BOOT for about 1.5 seconds turns off the backlight without changing pages.
When the screen is dark, a short BOOT press wakes it without changing pages. Touch also wakes it;
the first touch does not activate any page control.

The settings page offers brightness choices of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, plus idle screen-off after
never, 1, 3, or 5 minutes. The iPhone's “My display” sheet has the same controls. It reads the device's
current values after connection and sends changes back; the device stores the selected values for restart.
The defaults are 100% brightness and 3-minute idle screen-off. During active navigation the screen does
not turn off automatically, but a long BOOT press can still turn it off manually. Without active navigation,
the backlight dims to at most 25% after one third of the selected timeout and turns off at the timeout.
Only the backlight turns off: the device, BLE connection and navigation processing continue to run. Use PWR
to turn off the whole board after the ride. The device settings page compiles locally and awaits
flashing and hardware verification; the iPhone settings page awaits an iOS build and live check.

The 1.85B shows device battery percentage near the upper right. A green charging mark appears when
the gauge detects charge current; the number turns red at 20% or less. No percentage is shown until
the gauge has a valid reading. Accuracy still needs checking with the connected battery on hardware.
The 1.75C does not yet display device battery level.

The speedometer page shows the speed and `km/h`. The speed depends on a valid position fix or on demo
input, and is not the same as the result of calibrating the vehicle's original instrument. When the
phone provides no valid data, do not treat a retained screen as the latest speed.

The heading page shows the angle and the eight-point compass direction; while riding, the phone's
positioning heading is the reference and the on-board sensor assists with relative turning. The
QMI8658 has no magnetometer, so when you are stopped and turn the device in place it must not be
treated as a calibrated true-north compass.

A long press on the screen no longer starts the on-device demo. The long-press demo behaviour in
older version records has been removed.

### Bluetooth firmware updates

“My Display” can transfer a project application `.bin` built for the **1.85B** from iPhone Files over Bluetooth. The first upgrade still requires USB flashing of the new dual-slot partition layout; older firmware has no update service. Update while stopped, with stable display power and the app in the foreground. See the [Bluetooth update guide](OTA_UPDATE.en.md) for the file, first flash and recovery steps.

## 7. Apple Music control

First play a song that the current account can play in the iPhone's system "Music" app and allow MOTO
GPS to access the media library, then return to MOTO GPS and connect the round display. The music page
can show the track state and use the following buttons:

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Previous track | Sends a previous-track command to the system "Music" player |
| Play / pause | Toggles the current playback state |
| Next track | Sends a next-track command to the system "Music" player |

The round display is a remote control; it does not download songs, carry audio or replace headphones.
Whether playback is possible depends on the phone's music source, account, authorisation and playback
queue. Generic control of third-party players such as NetEase Cloud Music is not supported at
present, and there is no favourite / like action. If a button does not respond, first check whether
the phone's "Music" app can play at all, then check the media permission and the BLE state.

## 8. Demo navigation and ending navigation

On the phone's home page tap "Demo navigation". The demo uses the scenario from near Building D of
the Jinan Big Data Industry Base to near the Inspur headquarters, requests a live route first when
online and falls back to the built-in OSM track when that fails. Once you are in, the phone keeps
showing "demo", and the movement, speed and distance on screen are simulated input.

The demo suits checking turns, touch, the map and the connection at a desk. It cannot demonstrate
real-road accuracy, background operation with the screen locked or live traffic. To use a real
destination, first tap "End navigation" to leave the demo, then search again, select a route and
start.

After live navigation arrives, look at the phone's "You have arrived" prompt and tap
"End navigation" to end the current session; you can also end it manually partway. After stopping,
confirm that the round display has left the active-route state. Before leaving the phone, end any
navigation you no longer need, so that it does not keep consuming location and battery.

## 9. Screen lock, loss of network and disconnection

The App configures background location and BLE, but the current version still has known issues such
as waiting for the phone after leaving the original network environment, and background recovery. For
first use, do a short stationary verification and then extend the time gradually; do not infer
long-term stability from one success.

| Situation | Suggested action |
| --- | --- |
| The round display stops updating after the phone's screen locks | Stop, open the App and see whether it recovers in the foreground; check the "Always" location, precise location and Bluetooth permissions |
| The phone has no network | Downloaded base maps and cache remain usable; online search / planning / rerouting / live traffic are still affected |
| The round display loses power or goes out of Bluetooth range | Power it on again, move closer to the phone and wait for reconnection; if it is stuck, use "Retry" in the App |
| Force-quitting the App | Location and the connection may stop and you need to open it again; do not rely on automatic recovery after a force quit |
| Changing phones or hitting an old-pairing problem | Close the App / connection on the original phone first; handle the old pairing following the actual system prompts and do not erase the whole Flash at will |

## 10. Online surrounding maps and offline downloads

During navigation, nearby roads and buildings load online by default. You do not need to choose a
city first or change the program when travelling elsewhere. Your gateway must support the map APIs;
working route planning alone does not prove that the map source is available.

### Download a city or district

1. Open "Maps and offline downloads" from home, then "Download city map".
2. Search for a city or district, such as "上海" or "历下区", and choose a result.
3. Review the blue download boundary, then tap "Download map". It is the administrative area's
   bounding rectangle, so its edges may include neighbouring areas.
4. Choose a smaller district if the area is too large. "Download incomplete" does not mean the whole area is saved.

### Download around a route

After selecting a candidate, open "Maps and offline downloads" on the route page and tap "Download
around this route". It saves roughly one kilometre around the route, not the entire rectangle between
two cities. During navigation, use "Manage offline maps"; the download then follows the active route,
including an accepted reroute.

### Resume downloads and free storage

- Keep the App running during downloads; Wi-Fi is recommended. Use "Pause download" and then
  "Continue download" on a saved item. Downloads can resume after an App restart; uninterrupted
  background downloading after screen lock is not guaranteed.
- Swipe a saved item left to delete it. "Clear automatic cache" preserves manual downloads. The
  bundled Jinan base map remains part of the App.
- Automatic cache is limited to 128 MiB and manual downloads to 512 MiB in total. Cities and routes
  share stored tiles. Limits count file contents; actual disk use can be slightly higher. Oversized
  regions or routes are rejected and require a smaller scope.
- **Offline packages contain only road and building backgrounds.** They do not include offline place
  search, route planning, live traffic, speed limits or countdowns. After a detour outside the saved
  region, background maps may be missing if there is no network.

## 11. Permissions, privacy and release status

"Privacy and data" on home can be read offline. Location and search data pass through your configured
gateway to AMap, and online map requests reveal the viewed area. Reverse-proxy access logs may retain
IP addresses, request times, search terms and location parameters. Operators must verify their logging
and backup policies; no login requirement does not mean no data collection. Phone route previews use
Apple Maps; display backgrounds use OpenStreetMap / Protomaps. Music details go to the display over
Bluetooth, not to the navigation gateway.

Recent places and the peripheral connection identifier are stored on the phone. Clear recent searches
from home, and remove downloads or automatic cache from the map page. "Disconnect" ends a connection
without removing the stored peripheral identifier. Deleting the App removes local data; system backups
may contain some local data, while the downloaded-map directory is excluded from backup. Location,
Bluetooth and media-library permissions can be revoked in iOS Settings.

The project includes `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`; this does not mean Apple review has passed or a public
privacy policy is complete. As of 2026-09-16, TestFlight preparation is underway, but no build has been
uploaded to Apple, submitted for external beta review or opened for invitations. Source installations
still need your own signing and gateway. The repository and website do not provide a free public gateway.

## 12. First-use checklist

- [ ] The App opens normally on your own physical iPhone and its signing is valid.
- [ ] The round display can be connected after power-on, and the App and the round display states
  agree.
- [ ] The demo can be started, paged through and ended, and after exiting it does not keep showing the
  demo route.
- [ ] You have switched to your own HTTPS gateway and can search real places and get a route.
- [ ] The candidate destination, the selected route and the navigation after starting agree.
- [ ] Online surrounding maps load; if needed offline, packages are complete and cover the intended area.
- [ ] You have checked recovery after a short screen lock, a device restart and a phone network
  switch.
- [ ] The music buttons you intend to use have been verified on both the phone and the round display.
- [ ] The power cable and the mount are reliable in the actual installation position and do not
  interfere with operating the vehicle.

Problem records are in [Known issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.en.md); for installation and signing troubleshooting
see the [DIY guide](WAVESHARE_DIY_GUIDE.en.md#8-frequently-asked-questions). This manual describes the
current implementation; resources such as the microphone and speaker that come with the hardware do
not mean this App already supports voice navigation or a voice assistant.
